# (Lemi) iOS Developer - Coding Challenge


## General
This app supports the following:
- Dark mode

## Project Structure

## Third Party Libraries
- Since the API call is very basic and I think using URLSession is more than enough for this project, so I decided not to use any third party library like Alamofire
- There's a ton of helpful third party libraries avaialble (like RxSwift) in the market right now. However, in my opinion, using first party libraries are more than enough to complete this task.
